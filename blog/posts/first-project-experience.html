      <p>I worked on a smart energy monitoring system using an Arduino and various sensors. The experience was incredibly valuable and helped me understand the real-world applications of embedded systems. It bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge from my classes and practical, hands-on engineering.</p>

      <p>This is where you can write multiple paragraphs, going into full detail about the project, the challenges you faced, and what you learned. The page can be as long as you want!</p>
      
      <h2>The Goal of the Project</h2>
      <p>The main objective was to create a non-invasive device that could attach to a home's main power line to collect and interpret power usage data. This data could then be used to identify which appliances consume the most energy, helping homeowners make smarter decisions to reduce their electricity bills.</p>

      <h2>Components and Technology Used</h2>
      <p>Here you can list the components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno R3</li>
        <li>SCT-013-000 Non-invasive Current Sensor</li>
        <li>ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module for data transmission</li>
        <li>A custom-built PCB to house the components cleanly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges was calibrating the sensor to get accurate current readings. This involved a lot of trial and error and diving deep into the sensor's datasheet. We eventually wrote a calibration sketch that compared our sensor's output to a known value from a commercial multimeter, which solved the problem.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, this project was a fantastic learning experience. It taught me not only about embedded systems and data acquisition but also about project management and problem-solving under pressure. I'm excited to apply these skills to my next project!</p>
