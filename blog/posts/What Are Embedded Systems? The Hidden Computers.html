      <p>You probably used a dozen computers before you even started your day, but most of them didn't have a screen or a keyboard. They are hidden inside your microwave, your car's engine, your washing machine, and your TV remote. These are <strong>embedded systems</strong>: specialized computer systems designed to perform one specific task.</p>
      
      <h2>The Difference from a Normal PC</h2>
      <p>Unlike a general-purpose computer (like your laptop) which can run thousands of different applications, an embedded system is a master of one trade. The software is written directly onto its memory and is rarely, if ever, changed. This specialization makes them incredibly efficient and reliable.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        An embedded system is a computer that doesn't look like a computer. It's the dedicated brain inside a larger machine.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The Rise of the Maker</h2>
      <p>In the past, developing embedded systems was exclusively for highly-skilled engineers. However, the game changed with the arrival of low-cost microcontrollers like the <strong>Arduino</strong> and single-board computers like the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>. These platforms made embedded systems accessible to everyone.</p>
      <p>Now, students, hobbyists, and artists can bring their ideas to life, building everything from home automation systems to robots. This "maker movement" has fueled a massive wave of innovation and has become a fantastic entry point for anyone interested in a career in engineering or computer science.</p>
