      <p>In the world of technology and manufacturing, the terms "robotics" and "automation" are often used interchangeably. While they are closely related, they represent two distinct concepts. Understanding the difference is key to understanding the modern industrial landscape.</p>
      
      <h2>Automation: Performing a Process</h2>
      <p><strong>Automation</strong> is when you use technology to perform a task or a process with minimal human assistance. The key word here is <em>process</em>. Think of a bottling plant: a conveyor belt moves bottles, a machine fills them with liquid, and another machine screws on the caps. This entire workflow is an automated system. It's designed to do one sequence of tasks very efficiently and repetitively.</p>

      <h2>Robotics: Performing a Physical Task</h2>
      <p><strong>Robotics</strong> is a field of engineering focused on creating robots: physical machines that can be programmed to perform a variety of tasks. A robot is often a <em>component within an automated system</em>. For example, on that automated bottling line, a robotic arm might be used to pick up the finished bottles and place them into a box. That arm could be reprogrammed to pick up different-sized bottles or perform a completely different task tomorrow.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        Automation is the entire self-operating system. A robot is the flexible, programmable machine that works within it.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Working Together in Harmony</h2>
      <p>The best systems use both. Automation provides the rigid, efficient structure, while robots provide the flexible "muscle" needed to handle complex or changing physical jobs. A fully automated warehouse, for instance, uses a software system to manage inventory (automation) and sends mobile robots (robotics) to go and retrieve the items. Together, they create a system that is far more powerful than either could be on its own.</p>
