      <p>Every smart device, from an IoT weather station to an industrial robot, needs to understand the world around it. It does this using <strong>sensors</strong>‚Äîthe electronic equivalent of our human senses. A sensor is a device that detects changes in the environment and sends that information to a computer or microcontroller.</p>
      
      <h2>Common Types of Sensors</h2>
      <p>While there are thousands of specialized sensors, most projects are built using a handful of common types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Temperature & Humidity Sensors:</strong> As the name suggests, these measure ambient temperature and moisture in the air. They are the backbone of smart thermostats and weather stations.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity Sensors:</strong> These detect when an object is near without any physical contact. Your phone uses one to turn off the screen when you hold it to your ear. Robots use them to avoid obstacles.</li>
        <li><strong>Light Sensors (Photoresistors):</strong> These detect the presence and intensity of light. They are used in automatic streetlights and to adjust the screen brightness on your devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Accelerometers & Gyroscopes:</strong> These measure motion. An accelerometer detects linear movement, while a gyroscope detects rotational movement. Your smartphone uses both to know which way you're holding it.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <blockquote>
        Sensors are the crucial bridge between the physical, analog world and the digital world of computers.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
      <p>The real magic happens when you combine multiple sensors. A home security system might use a motion sensor to detect an intruder, a light sensor to turn on the lights, and a connection to the internet to send you an alert. Understanding the basics of these sensors is the first step toward building any smart device.</p>
